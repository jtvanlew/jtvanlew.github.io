	abstract	= {This paper presents an experimental study and analysis of the heat transfer of energy charge and discharge in a packed-bed thermocline thermal storage tank for application in concentrated solar thermal power plants. Because the energy storage efficiency is a function of many parameters including fluid and solid properties, tank dimensions, packing dimensions, and time lengths of charge and discharge, this paper aims to provide experimental data and a proper approach of data reduction and presentation. To accomplish this goal, dimensionless governing equations of energy conservation in the heat transfer fluid and solid packed-bed material are derived. The obtained experimental data will provide a basis for validation of mathematical models in the future.}

	abstract	= {Parabolic trough power systems utilizing concentrated solar energy have proven their worth as a means for generating electricity. However, one major aspect preventing the technologies widespread acceptance is the deliverability of energy beyond a narrow window during peak hours of the sun. Thermal storage is a viable option to enhance the dispatchability of the solar energy and an economically feasible option is a thermocline storage system with a low-cost filler material. Utilization of thermocline storage facilities have been studied in the past and this paper hopes to expand upon that knowledge. The heat transfer between the heat transfer fluid and filler materials are governed by two conservation of energy equations, often referred as Schumann [1] equations. We solve these two coupled partial differential equations using Laplace transformation. The initial temperature distribution can be constant, linear or exponential. This flexibility allows us to apply the model to simulate unlimited charging and discharging cycles, similar to a day-to-day operation. The analytical model is used to investigate charging and discharging processes, and energy storage capacity. In an earlier paper [2], the authors presented numerical solution of the Schumann equations using method of characteristics. Comparison between analytical and numerical results shows that they are in very good agreement.}

	abstract 	= {This paper examined the features of three typical thermal storage systems including: 1) direct storage of heat transfer fluid in containers, 2) storage of thermal energy in a packed bed of solid filler material, with energy being carried in/out by a flowing heat transfer fluid which directly contacts the packed bed, and 3) a system in which heat transfer fluid flows through tubes that are imbedded into a thermal storage material which may be solid, liquid, or a mixture of the two. The similarity of the three types of thermal storage systems was discussed, and generalized energy storage governing equations were introduced in both dimensional and dimensionless forms. The temperatures of the heat transfer fluid during energy charge and discharge processes and the overall energy storage efficiencies were studied through solution of the energy storage governing equations. Finally, provided in the paper are a series of generalized charts bearing curves for energy storage effectiveness against four dimensionless parameters grouped up from many of the thermal storage system properties including dimensions, fluid and thermal storage material properties, as well as the operational conditions including mass flow rate of the fluid, and the ratio of energy charge and discharge time periods. Engineers can conveniently look up the charts to design and calibrate the size of thermal storage tanks and operational conditions without doing complicated individual modeling and computations. It is expected that the charts will serve as standard tools for thermal storage system design and calibration.},

	abstract	= {Solar thermal energy storage is important to the daily extended operation and cost reduction of a concentrated solar thermal power plant. To provide industrial engineers with an effective tool for sizing a thermocline heat storage tank, this paper used dimensionless heat transfer governing equations for fluid and solid filler material and studied all scenarios of energy charge and discharge processes. It has been found that what can be provided through the analysis is a series of well-configured general charts bearing curves of energy storage effectiveness against four dimensionless parameters grouped up from the storage tank dimensions, properties of the fluid and filler material, and operational conditions (such as mass flow rate of fluid and energy charge and discharge periods). As the curves in the charts are generalized, they are applicable to general thermocline heat storage systems. Engineers can conveniently look up the charts to design and calibrate the dimensions of thermocline solar thermal storage tanks and operational conditions, without doing complicated modeling and computations. It is of great significance that the generalized charts will serve as tools for thermal energy storage system design and calibration in energy industry.}

	abstract	= {This work studied the issues of uniform flow distribution for general application in fuel cells, fuel processing chemical reactors, and other industrial devices. A novel method for uniform flow distribution was proposed, in which multiple levels of flow channel bifurcations were considered to uniformly distribute a flow into 2n flow channels at the final stage, after n levels of bifurcation. To study the effect of the flow channel bifurcation structure and dimensions on the flow distribution uniformity, numerical analysis was conducted. Parameters such as the flow channel length and width at each level of bifurcation as well as the curvature of the turning area of flow channels were particularly investigated. Important results concerning the geometrical design of flow distributors for better flow distribution and uniformity are presented. The best structure of a flow distributor was selected based on the criterion of flow distribution uniformity and low pressure loss. Since the studied novel flow distributor distributes a flow into a number of parallel channels in a remarkable uniformity, the flow distribution structure is expected to be widely used in fuel cells, fuel cell systems, and variety of industrial reactors and heat exchangers to significantly improve the performance of these devices. The studied flow regime is limited to laminar flow. A CFD tool FLUENT was used for the simulation. The numerical treatment of convection terms in governing equations was based on the QUICK scheme, and the coupled computation solving for pressure and velocity fields was based on the SIMPLE algorithm.}

	abstract	= {Symmetric flow channel bifurcations were proposed in this article for the purpose of creating better flow uniformity in flow distribution. Two categories of flow channel bifurcation structures were considered. Characteristic parameters that can identify and standardize the structural design of the flow channel bifurcations were designated. Six flow distributors, divided into two groups, were fabricated for experimental testing. Each group of distributors is distinguished by one basic channel bifurcation structure category, but distributors within a group differ in the characteristic parameters exhibited in their designs. The axial velocities of the airflow at the exit of the distributor flow channels were measured experimentally, and the uniformity of the flow distribution was investigated for each distributor. Comparison and evaluation of the figure-of-merit of flow distribution uniformity is made for the six studied flow distributors. The novel concept of symmetrically bifurcated flow distributor designs and the experimental results and conclusions obtained in this study are of great significance to the development of high performance industrial devices, such as heat exchangers, reactors, fuel cells, heat sinks, and fluid product packaging machines.}

A mathematical analysis was provided for better understanding and planning of the experimental tests. The mathematical analysis indicated that the energy storage effectiveness is related to fluid and solid material properties, tank dimensions, packing schemes of the solid filler material, and the durations of the charge and discharge times. Dimensional analysis of the governing equations was applied to consolidate many parameters into a few dimensionless parameters, allowing scaling from a laboratory system to an actual industrial application. Experiences on the system design, packing of solid filler material, system operation, and data analysis in a laboratory-scale system have been obtained in this work. These data are used to validate a recently published numerical solution method. The study will benefit the application of thermocline thermal storage systems in the large scale concentrated solar thermal power plants in industry.}

	abstract	= {Thermal storage has been considered as an important measure to extend the operation of a concentrated solar power plant by providing more electricity and meeting the peak demand of power in the time period from dusk to late night everyday, or even providing power on cloudy days. Discussed in this paper is thermal energy storage in a thermocline tank having a solid filler material. To provide more knowledge for designing and operating of such a thermocline storage system, this paper firstly presents the application of method of characteristics for numerically predicting the heat charging and discharging process in a packed bed thermocline storage tank. Nondimensional analysis of governing equations and numerical solution schemes using the method of characteristics were presented. The numerical method proved to be very efficient, accurate; required minimal computations; and proved versatile in simulating various operational conditions for which analytical methods cannot always provide solutions. Available analytical solutions under simple boundary and initial conditions were used to validate the numerical modeling and computation. A validation of the modeling by comparing the simulation results to experimental test data from literature also confirmed the effectiveness of the model and the related numerical solution method. Finally, design procedures using the numerical modeling tool were discussed and other issues related to operation of a thermocline storage system were also studied.}

	abstract	= {The discrete element method, as currently employed by members of the fusion community, is rooted on the assumption that each pebble is a perfectly elastic material that obeys Hertz's theory for normal interaction. This assumption impacts the magnitude of inter-particle forces predicted by the models. We scrutinize the Hertzian assumption with single-pebble crush experiments with carefully recorded force-displacement responses and compare them to the non-linear forces predicted by a Hertzian pebble with bulk properties reported in literature. We found each pebble generally has a non-linear force response but with varying levels of stiffness that qualitatively matched the curves from Hertz theory. Assuming Hertzian interaction, we backed-out an elastic modulus for each pebble. We define a softening coefficient, κ, as the ratio of the pebble's elastic modulus to the sintered bulk value from literature. After determining the κ value for every pebble in our batch, we discovered a probability distribution for different batches. The distribution is attributed to the varying micro-structure of each pebble. We incorporate the results into our DEM algorithms, distributing κ values at random to pebbles satisfying the probability curves of experiments. DEM simulations of pebble beds in oedometric compression are carried out to determine macroscopic responses of stress–strain, contact force distributions at maximum stress, and a prediction of pebbles crushing at that point. In all cases studied here, the pebble beds with modified Young's modulus had smaller overall contact forces and fewer predicted crushed pebbles.}

Simultaneously, the helium purge gas flow through the pebble bed can change; while not specifically playing a role as coolant, it does have an impact on the thermal transport in the volumetrically heated bed. We present numerical tools that are capable of resolving pebble-scale interactions coupled to bed-scale thermofluid flow. The new computational techniques are used to show that maximum temperatures in pebble beds do not increase drastically in spite of the significant amount of cracking induced in our numerical model. Furthermore a complete flow field of helium moving through densely packed spheres is modeled with the lattice-Boltzmann method to reveal the strong effect of slow-moving helium gas on flattening temperature profiles in pebble beds with nuclear heating.}

	abstract	= {The discrete element method (DEM) is used to study the thermal effects of pebble failure in an ensemble of lithium ceramic spheres. Some pebbles crushing in a large system is unavoidable and this study provides correlations between the extent of pebble failure and the reduction in effective thermal conductivity of the bed. In the model, we homogeneously induced failure and applied nuclear heating until dynamic and thermal steady-state. Conduction between pebbles and from pebbles to the boundary is the only mode of heat transfer presently modeled. The effective thermal conductivity was found to decrease rapidly as a function of the percent of failed pebbles in the bed. It was found that the dominant contributor to the reduction was the drop in inter-particle forces as pebbles fail; implying the extent of failure induced may not occur in real pebble beds. The results are meant to assist designers in the fusion energy community who are planning to use packed beds of ceramic pebbles. The evolution away from experimentally measured thermomechanical properties as pebbles fail is necessary for proper operation of fusion reactors.}

	abstract = {We apply coupled computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD-DEM) modeling tools with new numerical implementations of pebble fragmentation to study the combined effects of granular crushing and ensemble restructuring, granular fragment size, and initial packing for different breeder volume configurations. In typical solid breeder modules, heat removal from beds relies on maintaining pebble–pebble and pebble–wall contact integrity. However, contact is disrupted when an ensemble responds to individually crushed pebbles. Furthermore, restructuring of metastable packings after crushing events are, in part, dependent on gravity forces acting upon the pebbles. We investigate two representative pebble bed configurations under constant volumetric heat sources; modeling heat removed from beds via inter-particle conduction, purge gas convection, and contact between pebble beds and containers. In one configuration, heat is removed from at walls oriented parallel to the gravity vector (no gap formation possible); in the second, heat is removed at walls perpendicular to gravity, allowing for the possibility of gap formation between bed and wall. Judging beds on increase in maximum temperatures as a function of crushed pebble amount, we find that both pebble bed configurations to have advantageous features that manifest at different stages of pebble crushing. However, all configurations benefit from achieving high initial packing fractions.},
