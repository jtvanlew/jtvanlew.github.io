This is my personal website using a Jekyll theme that's, in places, a heavily modified version of the one made by H.M. Faysal: http://hmfaysal.github.io/
  
The main features:

* Zurb Foundation 5 â€“ css framework
* Scss files with settings file
* Fullscreen post covers with header wich will be bright or dark according to background image
* Fast and light
* Font Awesome
* Disqus comments integration

You can set post image covers by using only Kramdown narkdown, just place something like this: `![cover-image](http://path-to-your-image.jpg)`
