These interactive travel maps are organized, roughly, by region and you can drill down through country/state into cities. Alternatively you can just view the albums directly on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jtvanlew/sets">flickr</a>.

At present these maps these look terrible on mobile devices. I would recommend not even trying to view them on a screen smaller than a tablet. If you're on a nice, big screen they'll look and work great(ish). Enjoy.
