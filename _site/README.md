This is my personal website using a Jekyll theme that's a (in places) heavily modified version of the one made by H.M. Faysal: http://hmfaysal.github.io/

The site name is dedicated to my little Taiwanese Mountain Dog, Molly. You can read more about her in the About page of the site. 

Feel free to fork it for yourself, hmfaysal did most of the work and I only hacked at it to fit better with my aesthetics with color and typography. So if you want to credit anyone, credit him. His github repo (linked above) has much detail on the features of the site.
