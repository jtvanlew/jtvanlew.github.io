#About me (kind of)

<div class="circle large" style="background-image: url('{{ site.url }}/img/vanlew_profile.jpg')"></div>

That's me and this is Molly, the eponymous little black dog:

This is the start of Molly's story, written by the rescue agency that found her:

2012年二月初，台灣動物緊急救援小組大隊長在執行例行性巡邏時，途經高雄市燕巢區一處養豬場旁，發現有兩隻剛出生不久的小幼犬穿梭在附近的草堆內，動物救援小組大隊長靠近仔細查看後發現兩隻小狗身上都患有嚴重的皮膚病，又不見母狗在身旁照顧，動物救援小組大隊長便將兩隻小幼犬送往動物醫院接受皮膚病治療，並會在狗兒療程結束恢復健康後，為牠們尋找溫暖新家。

Perhaps you notice a peculiarity of the story. Like... the fact it's written in Chinese. Well that's because Molly and her sister were found outside a pig farm in Taiwan with a skin disease and no mother around to take care of them. A rescue agency from Taiwan took her in and put her online for up for adoption online -- which is how we came to find her. Then it was simply a matter of her flying to LAX with a volunteer where we went to pick her up. Here's Molly a few days after she arrived in Los Angeles,

I love this dog. I'm close to surviving life in grad school and I owe any of my remaining sanity to this girl. As thanks, I've named my site in her honor.

#About this site
The home page is for posts on brewing, engineering, etc. etc. Then there's the Photo Maps I made to show off my picture albums. Finally, there's a page that exists only for my own practice of writing Chinese.
