While my 'professional', more-static site can be found at [jon.vanlew.net](http://jon.vanlew.net), what you're looking at now is supposed to be easier to blog through with GitHub's Jekyll implementation. I never have anything interesting to say, but I still sometimes post here. The blog is named after my beauitful dog, Molly. This is Molly, the eponymous little black dog:

This is the start of Molly's story, as written by the rescue agency that found her:

2012年二月初，台灣動物緊急救援小組大隊長在執行例行性巡邏時，途經高雄市燕巢區一處養豬場旁，發現有兩隻剛出生不久的小幼犬穿梭在附近的草堆內，動物救援小組大隊長靠近仔細查看後發現兩隻小狗身上都患有嚴重的皮膚病，又不見母狗在身旁照顧，動物救援小組大隊長便將兩隻小幼犬送往動物醫院接受皮膚病治療，並會在狗兒療程結束恢復健康後，為牠們尋找溫暖新家。

See, I'm being a little silly. Molly and her sister were found abandoned near a pig farm in southern Taiwan with a skin disease and no mother nearby. So it was that a Taiwanese rescue agency put her up for adoption and we found her. Here's Molly a few days after she arrived in Los Angeles,

I love this dog and I owe any of my remaining sanity to this girl. If not for her, I'd have been significantly more miserable through my PhD program.
