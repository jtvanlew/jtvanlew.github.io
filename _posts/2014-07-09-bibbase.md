I put together an online version of my [resume](http://jon.vanlew.net/cv/index.php)) that I wanted to keep updated with a list of publications. Google Scholar has a nice, automatically updated list but their site is ugly and I don't know of a way to integrate it into my own. But I also keep on top of my work in a databse inside Mendeley, so I went looking for something to integrate with that -- finding [bibbase](http://www.bibbase.org). This little service will fetch data from Mendeley's online sync of my database and then display it in html. 

After I got it into my page, however, I wasn't thrilled with the old and large icons used for external links. Here's an example:

I emailed the creator, Dr. Christian Fritz, who said he'd just never revisited the code after using those first simple and default icons. He's a busy guy I assume, so I hacked together a fix on my own with some css. On my pages, I have a local.css file that into which I just added these few lines:

{% highlight css %}
span.dontprint img {
display: none !important;
}
.bibbase_icon_text:before {
    font-family: FontAwesome;
    content: "\f08e  link ";
}
{% endhighlight %}
- - - - -	

A snippet of the result (in case you don't want to actually view my resume) is thusly

So now I've got sweet little FontAwesome icons for the external links and pdf references. Similar modifications can be used by anyone to make Bibbase much more compatible with the overall aesthetic of their website.
