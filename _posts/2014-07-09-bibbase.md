I have an online resume (linked in my sidebar, or [here](http://jon.vanlew.net/cv/index.php)) that I like to keep updated with a list of publications. Even though Google Scholar has a nice, automatically updated list and I likewise keep on top of my work with Mendeley -- it was totally manual when I imported to any document (printed or digital CVs). Until I found [bibbase](http://www.bibbase.org). This little service requires you to keep up a Mendeley publications list but then will fetch the data and display it in html. 

After I got it into my page, however, I wasn't thrilled with the old and large icons used for external links. Here's an example:

I emailed the creator, Dr. Christian Fritz, who said he'd just never revisited the code after using those first simple and default icons. He's a busy guy I assume, so I hacked together a fix on my own with some css. On my pages, I have a local.css file that I reference. It overrides other external css scripts I may link to so that specific formats I want are the ones ultimately assigned. In that local.css file then, I just added these few lines:

 
	span.dontprint img {
    display: none !important;
	}
	.bibbase_icon_text:before {
	    font-family: FontAwesome;
	    content: "\f08e  link ";
	}

The result (in case you don't want to actually view my resume) is thusly

Aren't those tiny FontAwesome external links much better and inline with the rest of the page style? I think so. Bibbase is a neat little feature to add to a website. This little tweak makes it even nicer to integrate into modern designs.
