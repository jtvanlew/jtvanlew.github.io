## Basically the next Ken Jennings

For the last 8 or so weeks during the stay-at-home orders, KCRW hosted a live, online trivia game every afternoon at 4pm. The questions were often related to news bits that had been on the show in the previous several days, or just random facts sometimes related to the station. The bit was, if you won one of those days you were invited back to a championship showdown. Long story short, I was in a zoom conference call with my engineering team at work and am SUCH A BOSS I simultaneously logged into the championship round and won!

I received this sweet certificate

With which I sent them a selfie for this sweet shoutout on twitter and in their newsletters.

I've become drunk on my fame and need LA to understand that this is now my town.
