Mom got me a bitchin, heavy-duty Wike trailer for my past birthday. I was afraid Molly might find it a little frightening so I wanted to put her bed into it to help soothe her and get her accustomed to it. But she jumped up onto it before I even had a chance to bribe her with treats.

When I get back into town I've got to make it into a covered wagon so it'll be safe to trasnport little Molly around LA.
