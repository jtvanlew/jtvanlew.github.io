Cindy and my Mom got me this awesome heavy-duty Wike trailer for my past birthday. They knew how badly I wanted to tow Molly around -- especially looking forward to the next cicLAvia coming up. 

Right when I put it together, I was ready to force Molly onto it. But considering she's afraid of piles of wet cardboard, I was concerned she might find it a little intimidating. I put her bed into it to help soothe her and maybe prevent her from being traumatized by it. The little turd jumped up onto it before I even had a chance to bribe her with treats!
