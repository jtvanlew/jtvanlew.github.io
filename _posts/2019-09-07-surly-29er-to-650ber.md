## Chapter 1: The Brompton Beginnings
This begins with me ~~stealing~~ saving Cindy's Brompton. She's drunk the Marie Kondo koolaid and has been purging everything that's fun from her garage. For a long time I was only using it as a dog runner at nights since the low top-tube made it really easy to get on and off for picking up their turds & the pint size is just convenient for going up and down in the apartment. The bike has always been fun to ride but my last shreds of dignity (and noticeable lack of tweed) meant every time I commuted to work or took it to liquor store I couldn't help but be self-concscious.

Enter: the huge rise in popularity of Byrds, Limes, Lyft-whateverthefucktheyares, and other e-scooters. For me, the greatest unintended consequence of these blights of sidewalks is their normalization of extremely nerdy modes of transportation. A giant nerd on a Brompton is now easily only the 4th most embarrassing way to get around the city. Because of that, I began riding a lot more regularly on the little folder. In time, I came to really appreciate the experience of an internally geared hub. Especially in contrast to riding on my SOMA where every major stand-up-crank would send me lurching from a skip in the chain (misaligned derailler? not-perfect friction shift? worn chainring? worn chain? worn rear cassette? some other exotic and undiagnosable piece of garbage?).

I began to daydream how nice a simple chain line would look on the Surly if I had an internal gear hub (SOMA's semi-vertical dropout would require a chain tensioner and kind of taint this image of beautiful chainline). For months I casually stalked ebay for a good deal on a Sturmey Archer until one morning there was a used RX-RF5 in great condition at a great price and I jumped on that grenade.

## Chapter 2: The Decision
I wanted to lace this hub to a 650b wheel. 

That's about it. There was no consideration if I should or if I could (actually all Google searches implied I most definitely _should not_). I had a front 650b wheel I'd built for another conversion of a Japanese steel road bike into a more-comfortable 650b toy. And I just want to finally have a matching rear wheel that I could stick big ol' 2+" tires on and still have it fit in my SOMA if I so chose.

Anyway, nothing exciting here, I took a weekend to lace the wheel up (ok and I paid a buddy with a truing stand to do the final touches) and waited around for new tubes and tires. I went with these beautiful Schwalbe gum wall tires (Schwalbe G-One Speed V-Guard) to add a little classic touch and the conversion was beginning to take shape.

## Chapter 3: Them's the Brakes
If you do see mention of 700c/29er to 650b conversions you'll see everyone say it can be done so long as you have a disc brake. Not one to be bothered by facts, I was planning to stick to V-brakes and this meant the cantilever posts on the Surly were going to be of no use to me. My first plan was to machine an adapter that had a shape something roughly like this (and in this iteration I was actually thinking to use some side-pull brakes):

![IMG_0178.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/IMG_0178.jpg)

In fact, there were a few iteration of ideas between me and my boy Tom, the designer/machinist from my old UCLA lab. But theeeenn. I found these bad boys from a chinese machine shop on ebay:

It was $15 for a full bike's worth of those adapters so I gave it a shot. The Surly sat with thsoe new wheels and no brakes for almost 2 weeks waiting for shipping from Shenzhen and I was getting more and more impatient to go out for a ride. They came in one evening I got home late from basketball and wanted to rush to install them. I was impatient enough that once the aluminum bolt was clearly not fitting into the braze-on for cantilever post, I just kept cranking down. Thank god it was aluminum bolt vs. steel frame because I sheared the shit out of that thing before I was luckily able to back it out without any permanent damage to my bike. I came to learn afterward that there are 2 standards for threading of cantilever posts. Some bikes use M10x1.25mm and some use M10x1mm. These adapters came with custom hex bolts with M10x1.25 and, without a doubt, the Surly is threaded for M10x1 -- a bolt that is much harder to come by. Ace Hardware, Home Depot, that unnamed Persian hardware store on Westwood, Amazon, ebay -- NONE OF THEM HAD ANY! Finally my only choice was through McMaster-Carr and when the new steel bolts finally showed up, there was another problem...

So now I had bolts that were too long, with caps too wide, oh and also the caps were too tall -- but at least they threaded into the braze-ons!

## Chapter 4: Machine Shop
So I called up my boy Tom again and we mobilized. He met me after work at the UCLA Physics machine shop in the alley behind Helen's Cycles. Which, by the by, also houses the UCLA tokamak device. A tokamak, for the uninitiated, as a type of gigantic magnetic device that can contain plasma at temepartures and pressures high enough to achieve fusion. The tokamak-style of fusion containment is currently our best guess at having a commercial fusion reactor but we're still many many years from realizing such a dream. And if you're curious, the reason I no longer work at UCLA in the fusion lab is because our funding from the Department of Energy was cut for reasons both political and practical but it's part of a larger trend to not fund fusion research and, personally, a bad idea. The tokamak:

So I was kind of unnecesary in the shop as Tom did everything. It all boiled down to needing to shave off nearly a quarter of an inch from the diameter and then trim off the face of the bolt cap.
