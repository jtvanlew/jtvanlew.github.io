# Overview

I've tracked all my spending with Mint.com for the last several years. I find their charts impossibly worthless from the vantage of wanting to actually see trends in spending. I've tried to be meticulous on my categorization over time with the hopes I could find long-term trends if any existed.

Some unnecessary background: I finished my PhD in mid-2016 and was hired as a post-doc at UCLA that summer through April of 2017, at which point I started at NantWorks. For that reason, I've only looked closely at the last 2 years of data because it's the first span of time I've actually had a discernable income. I suspect if I look at the years before that when I was living purely on grad student income in Los Angeles, my money all went to just rent and the leftovers for food (haha, just kidding, probably beer).

I've clumped lots of sub-categories into some major bins to make this large-scale view a little more digestable. Here's the main categories and the sub-categories

# Total spending over the last two years

The most obvious trend is that rent & bills are always the biggest offenders and the student loan payback period beginning in January of 2017 effectively doubled my spending rate in that category. Following that, most of my money was spent on Food (which included money spent eating out and at the bars) and transportation-related expenses.

# Income

As far as income during these two years (looking at post-tax and post-401k paychecks)... in 2016 you can see the major bump in pay between grad student salary and post-doc (even though I was actually being paid fairly well as a phd student during my last year in the lab). In 2017 there's a little dip between my last paycheck at UCLA and the first with NantWorks. In all, it's a rather unimpressive income chart.
