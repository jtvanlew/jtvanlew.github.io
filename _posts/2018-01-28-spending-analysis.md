# Overview

I've tracked all my spending with Mint.com for the last several years. I really appreciate how the site allows me to neurotically check in on my spending, but I find their charts impossibly worthless from the vantage of wanting to actually see trends in the aforementioned spending. I've personally been good at being meticulous and consistent in categorization over time so there's certainly fertile ground for someone to analyze my money sitchyuashun.

First some (unnecessary) background: What I'm going to show is only the most recent 2 years. I finished my PhD in mid-2016 and was hired as a post-doc at UCLA that summer through April of 2017, at which point I started at NantWorks. For that reason, I've only looked closely at this time span because I suspect if I look at the years before that when I was living purely on grad student income in Los Angeles, my money all went to just rent and the leftovers for food (haha, just kidding, probably beer).

I've clumped lots of sub-categories into some major bins to make this large-scale view a little more digestable. Here's them all

The most obvious trend is that rent & bills are always the biggest offenders and the student loan payback period beginning in January of 2017 effectively doubled my spending rate in that category. Following that, most of my money was spent on Food (which included money spent eating out and at the bars) and transportation-related expenses.
