I've pretty regularly been pumping out IPAs from my homebrew equipment. It's a style I know, I'm comfortable with, and by god I'm good at 'em. But the world needs balance -- and are not IPAs enjoyed even more when contrasted against other styles occasionally? I think a nice palate cleanser comes in the form of a crisp, clean medium-light amber. I was doing some 'market research' with Ballast Point's Calico amber ale. 

My initial reaction is probably best described as bitter jealousy. I marvelled at the unfairness that a brewery could not only produce a single beer as pure and delicious as their Sculpin, but that they could do it consistently with other styles like this Calico (and their other IPA, the Big Eye, and... let's face it, probably everything else they make). My second reaction was that I really wanted to copy this beer, so I went online to steal their secrets.

But I found instead that Ballast Point has begun this intriguing set of beers I want to share -- The Homework Series. For these beers, they simply take a popular recipe, produce it to their best ability, and then give that recipe right on the label for their drinkers to recreate on their own. The first of the series is this hoppy red ale:

As someone who's been in school for something like 50 years now, nothing gets me going quite like a good ol' fashioned homework assignment. So on top of continuing to try and steal their Calico recipe, I also now need to challenge myself by doing this hw and trying to duplicate their bottled product.
