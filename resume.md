* Ceramic pebble beds have been identified as a 'material' to be used for tritium breeding in fusion nuclear reactors. We are working to create numerical models that describe the thermomechanics of a pebble bed over the lifetime of the tritium breeding unit. I have been approaching the modeling from the point of view of interacting pebbles/particles with the discrete element method. A discrete element method (DEM) model considers, in a Lagrangian sense, the time-evolution of each individual pebble in an ensemble. The modeling techniques can capture pebble bed resettling due to disruptions such as cracked and broken pebbles. Transient, conductive heat transfer between pebbles is considered through their points of contact. Macroscopic properties of the pebble bed can be backed-out from volume averaging data output from the micro (pebble) level.

* In the absence of data from long-term, high temperature, cyclical loading experiments to draw upon, we must use numerical tools to predict the evolution of thermomechanical properties of ceramics in solid breeders. Using this pebble cracking routine in a DEM simulation, we have found the first results that indicate how the effective thermal conductivity decreases (from some ideal, well-packed initial state) when pebbles in the ensemble begin to crack.

* We have made use of the discrete element method to simulate a representative volume of pebbles from a generic solid breeder configuration. We then induce virtual breaking of pebbles to varying extents (up to 20% of the original ensemble are ‘broken’). After pebbles break and the ensemble resettles into a new packing structure -- accounting for the voids left behind, they are again run to steady state heating whereby new effective thermal conductivities are found. We found that in the worst case studied, the effective thermal conductivity was only about 30% of the original, well-packed pebble bed. The result is striking but must be considered with all of its limitations. First, the extent of failure in the worst case was induced and arbitrary; second, the influence of a flowing purge gas on effective thermal conductivity was not considered. The first point is important because we discovered that the average contact forces were sharply reduced after pebbles began ‘cracking’ in the system. In other words, pebble breakage in an ensemble appears not to be an avalanching problem, it is unlikely that we would experience something as dramatic as 20% of pebbles breaking. The second point is important because the heat transport of helium in these pebble beds is known from experiments to be very beneficial.

_Thesis_: “Transient heat delivery, storage process, and optimization of a packed bed thermocline thermal energy storage system”

In our lab at Arizona, we investigated energy storage capabilities of a solar-thermal power plant that had been supplemented with a thermocline-style storage tank. We demonstrated the feasibility of our laboratory’s thermocline design concept through an analysis of the physics of the thermal storage device. The transient simulation was done via the method of characteristics, written in MATLAB. The simulation was validated against a laboratory-scale model built and run on campus.

In addition to thermocline analysis, I continued research of optimized uniform flow distributers. I established an automated data acquisition device in the Fuel Cell and Energy Laboratory which the PI has continually used for measuring and comparing the uniformity of flow.
